  <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #f9f9f9;">WELCOME TO MALINI.CO</span></h1>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">In this website/company/project we try our&nbsp;<br />
    best to fit peoples needs (i guess)&nbsp;<br />
    BUT this website is specifically for&nbsp;<br />
    stuff I will introduce in the future...&nbsp;<br />
    I will include many things like videos, and a sort of...&nbsp;<br />
    tweet feature? I'm not sure-&nbsp;<br />
    but it will also be a place to buy things&nbsp;<br />
    and sell things and...&nbsp;<br />
    I guess you can say it's a video sharing site&nbsp;<br />
    that is also a comment sharing site&nbsp;<br />
    while also being a buy/sell website...&nbsp;<br />
    As of now...&nbsp;<br />
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">CONSTRUCTION WILL BEGIN SHORTLY</span></h3>
